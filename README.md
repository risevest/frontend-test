# Frontnend Engineer Test

See this [link](https://www.figma.com/file/Hevc45ogbUy06wVFK6Yzta/Home-Page?node-id=0%3A1) for a design of our current [landing page](https://risevest.com).
Implement this design and publish it to any hosting platform of your choosing. 


Our expectations and what we'll love to see:
- Complete the project using React
- Do not use any UI library/framework (e.g. Material UI)
- Make sure your implementation is responsive (Mobile and Desktop screens provided)
- Correct/Semantic use of HTML elements
- Great Accessibility


Reference our website for inspiration. Animations are nice to have, but not required for submission
